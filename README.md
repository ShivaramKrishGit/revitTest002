# Revit Geometry Optimizer

A web application for optimizing Revit (.rvt) geometry models to reduce triangle count. This tool helps you convert and optimize heavy geometry .rvt models to ensure they have less than 50,000 triangles.

## Features

- Upload .rvt files
- Display current triangle count
- Automatic geometry optimization
- Download optimized models

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Technologies Used

- React
- Three.js
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

## Development

This project is under active development. Key features being worked on:

- Revit file conversion
- Geometry optimization
- Triangle count analysis
